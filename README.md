# Smart Water Management

## Introduction
This is a smart water management application, which is a recent project developed with Flutter and powered by advanced deep learning technologies. The main objective of this application is to detect floods, predict rain, assess water quality, detect leaks, read water meters, and raise awareness to conserve water. We have integrated pre-trained deep learning models to ensure accurate classification and prediction.

## Features

1. **Flood Classification:**Users can upload an image to the application, then the application analyzes these images easily and detects floods in these areas.

2. **Rain Prediction :** The application provides a seamless experience by allowing users to upload a CSV file containing weather data. The app then processes this data and generates valuable predictions of future rainfall.

3. **Replenishing the amount of energy and oxygen for water purification:** The application receives CSV files with water-related information in order to reach the percentage of oxygen needed for effective water treatment. And the amount of energy required to process it

4. **Water Quality Assessment:** By analyzing water quality data stored in CSV files, Smart Water Management offers comprehensive evaluations
