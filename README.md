 # AI-Powered Classification App for Flood Detection, Rain Prediction, Water Quality, and Leak Detection

![App Image](image_link.png) (if available)

## Introduction

Our application is built using Flutter and leverages Deep Learning techniques to improve flood detection, rain prediction, water quality assessment, and leak detection. The app utilizes pre-trained deep learning models for classification and forecasting purposes.

## Features

1. **Flood and Rain Classification:** The app allows users to classify satellite images to detect and identify the presence of floods and rain in specific regions.

2. **Rain Prediction using CSV:** Users can upload a CSV file containing past rainfall data, and the app will analyze this data to make predictions for future rain occurrences.

3. **Estimating Water's Required Nutrients:** By uploading a CSV file with water data, the app will analyze the information and calculate the required nutrients, such as potassium, nitrogen, and oxygen, needed for water treatment.

4. **Water Quality Assessment:** The app can analyze a CSV file with water quality data to provide a comprehensive evaluation of water quality in specified areas.

5. **Leak Detection:** Users can upload a CSV file containing water consumption data, and the app will analyze it to detect any water leaks and identify their types.
