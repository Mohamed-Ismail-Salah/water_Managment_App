 # AI-Powered Classification App for Flood Detection, Rain Prediction, Water Quality, and Leak Detection

![App Image](image_link.png) (if available)

## Introduction

Our application is built using Flutter and leverages Deep Learning techniques to improve flood detection, rain prediction, water quality assessment, and leak detection. The app utilizes pre-trained deep learning models for classification and forecasting purposes.

## Features

1. **Flood and Rain Classification:** The app allows users to classify satellite images to detect and identify the presence of floods and rain in specific regions.

2. **Rain Prediction using CSV:** Users can upload a CSV file containing past rainfall data, and the app will analyze this data to make predictions for future rain occurrences.

3. **Estimating Water's Required Nutrients:** By uploading a CSV file with water data, the app will analyze the information and calculate the required nutrients, such as potassium, nitrogen, and oxygen, needed for water treatment.

4. **Water Quality Assessment:** The app can analyze a CSV file with water quality data to provide a comprehensive evaluation of water quality in specified areas.

5. **Leak Detection:** Users can upload a CSV file containing water consumption data, and the app will analyze it to detect any water leaks and identify their types.

## Installation and Usage

1. Download and install the application on Android or iOS smartphones using the provided download links (if available).

2. Once installed, users can take advantage of all the mentioned features through a user-friendly and straightforward interface.

## Technical Requirements
