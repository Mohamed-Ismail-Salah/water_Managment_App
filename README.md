## Introduction

Our application is called Smart Water Management, and it is a state-of-the-art project developed using Flutter and powered by advanced Deep Learning techniques. The primary goal of this app is to revolutionize flood detection, rain prediction, water quality assessment, and leak detection. We have integrated pre-trained deep learning models to ensure accurate classification and forecasting.

## Features

1. **Flood and Rain Classification:** With Smart Water Management, users can effortlessly analyze satellite images and detect floods and rain in specific regions.

2. **Rain Prediction using CSV:** The app provides a seamless experience by allowing users to upload historical rainfall data in CSV format. Smart Water Management then processes this data and generates valuable predictions for future rain occurrences.

3. **Estimating Water's Required Nutrients:** Smart Water Management is capable of intelligently calculating essential nutrients such as potassium, nitrogen, and oxygen required for effective water treatment. Users can upload CSV files with water-related information to access this feature.

4. **Water Quality Assessment:** By analyzing water quality data stored in CSV files, Smart Water Management offers comprehensive evaluations
